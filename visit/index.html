    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
    <br />

    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <article>
        <h6>Expectations</h6>

        <p class="align-left"> When you visit, expect to find open-minded, Bible-based teaching, and simple, God-honoring, Christ-centered, worship. Our sincere desire is to praise God in spirit and truth (John 4:24) while encouraging one another (1 Cor. 14:26).
<h6><span class="highlight">Teaching</span></h6>

The Bible class hour on both Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings provides a wonderful opportunity to discuss the Bible and Bible-related topics. Children can expect to have a lot of fun learning Bible lessons with songs, pictures, crafts, and sometimes videos. Adults can expect to find open, Bible-based discussions where truth is upheld while respecting differing views.
<h6>Singing</h6>

Song books are located in the racks in each pew (bench seat). Each song in the book has a corresponding number that the song leader will call out prior to singing. We sing a capella, and encourage everyone to participate (Col. 3:16).
<h6><span class="highlight">Prayer</span></h6>

Several men of the congregation will be called upon to lead prayers during the service (1 Tim. 2:8). Through prayer we are able to praise, honor, petition, and give thanks to God (Phil. 4:6).</p>
      </article>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <article>
        <p class="align-left"><h6>The Lord's Supper</h6>

        The Lord's Supper (communion) is a memorial instituted by Jesus on the night of His betrayal (Matt. 26:26-29), observed in memory of His death (1 Cor. 11:24-25). At this time we eat unleavened bread (symbolizing His body) and grape juice (symbolizing His blood). During this portion of the service, trays containing the bread will be passed, followed by trays of small cups containing the juice.

        We partake of the Lord's Supper every Sunday, as it holds special significance regarding the resurrection of Jesus (Matt. 28), and the establishment of his church (Acts 2:1ff).
        <h6><span class="highlight">Collection</span></h6>

        A collection is taken every Sunday in order to support the work of the church. This is an opportunity to give back a portion of what we have been given by God (2 Cor. 9:7). After the Lord's Supper, collection plates will be passed to receive these voluntary offerings. Visitors are not expected to give, so feel free to pass the plate on to the next person.
        <h6><span class="highlight">Regular</span> Preaching</h6>

        During the worship service, expect to hear a practical, easy-to-understand sermon rooted in Scripture. We currently have no full-time preacher, so several of us share the preaching duties.</p>

					<h3>What We Believe</h3>
					<p><span class="highlight">About God</span>…There is only one true God, the Creator of all life and Supreme Ruler of the universe. He is eternal and reveals Himself to us in three distinct and divine personalities: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. God wants nothing more than to have a loving, personal relationship with each of us that will last throughout eternity.

Genesis 1:26-27; Deuteronomy 6:4; Job 38:1-41:34; Matthew 3:13-17; John 3:16; Romans 1:19,20; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Ephesians 4:6</p>
</article>

<p><span class="highlight">About Jesus Christ</span>…Jesus Christ is the one and only Son of God. Co-equal with God the Father and God the Spirit, He came to earth and was both fully man and fully divine. He revealed to us who God is through His miraculous acts, sinless life, and life-changing teachings. He died on the cross, taking the sins of all mankind upon Himself, and paying the penalty that our sins deserve. After three days, He rose from the grave and ascended to Heaven where He sits at the right hand of God.

Matthew 1:22-23; John 1:1,14,18; Acts 10:37-43; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; Ephesians 2:4-8; Philippians 2:5-11; Colossians 1:15-21; Hebrews 1:1-3</p>

<p><span class="highlight">About the Holy Spirit</span>…The Holy Spirit is co-equal with God the Father and God the Son. He lives in each Christian as a Helper and Guide. He helps Christians to do what is right, provides strength to serve Jesus, and direction for living life God’s way.

John 14:16-17; John 16:7-13; Acts 2:38; 1 Corinthians 6:19-20; Ephesians 3:16-20; Ephesians 5:18</p>

<p><span class="highlight">About the Bible</span>…The Bible is God’s written Word, written by divinely inspired men to record the values and principles that Christian lives should be based on. The Word of God is accurate, reliable and trustworthy. It tells us who God is, why He loves us, and what His plans are for us. We accept the Bible as the timeless and ultimate authority and standard for living our lives according to God’s will.

Psalm 19:7-11; Psalm 119:105, 160; John 17:17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21</p>
